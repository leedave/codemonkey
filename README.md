# Code Monkey #

The purpose of this component is to help you be lazy at creating your code. 
structures. 

It allows you to generate full standardized code by only providing the dynamic
parts of you code.  

Set up is simple, all it requires is
* A JSON configuration file
* A very simple template file (text file containing placeholders) 

This project is purposely not connected to any programming language or syntax. 
The idea is that you can use it for any kind of project. For example:
* Create Code (PHP, Java, Phyton, .NET whatever)
* Create Data Structures (JSON, XML, YAML etc)
* Create Vagrant Machines 

Life is short and there are more fun things to do than to write code twice.
Let the machines do the dirty work
